## 1. Background
Fog is defined as a collection of small water droplets suspended close to the Earth's surface, 
causing visibility to drop below 1000 meters (Glickman, 2000). 
From a scientific and socioeconomic perspective, fog is of great importance as a modifier within the climate system, a barrier to traffic, 
and an association with compromised air quality [Jmark, 2008]. For example, fog disasters shorten the sunshine hours, 
reduce the light and efficiency of green plants, and reduce crop yields; urban fog contains a large amount of industrial pollutants, 
which contributes to the formation of acid fog. In addition, the foggy weather also seriously affected the operation efficiency of
many open-pit industrial and mining enterprises, causing huge losses [3]. It also has a direct impact on human life. The occurrence
of dense fog is often accompanied by the formation of an inversion layer, which leads to the accumulation of pollutants in the air 
and aggravates the harm of air pollution. The long-lasting dense fog is conducive to the breeding and spread of viruses and bacteria [4]. 
In addition to these negative effects, fog may also be beneficial to humans. For example, the high water vapor content of the fog provides
an important source of freshwater for the Atacama Desert along the coastline. Frequent fog is also critical to local human social activities, 
as fog water is collected to meet industrial needs [5]. In addition, fog also has certain ecological effects. For example, fog is an
important driver and major prerequisite for epiphyte richness in tropical montane cloud forests (Obregon et al, 2014). As a water source
for vegetation in arid regions (Pinto et al, 2001, Henschel et al, 2008, Lehnert et al, 2018), and as a major regulator of the entire 
ecosystem in the Montane Cloud Forest (MCF) in Taiwan (Li H. J. et al, 2015).
